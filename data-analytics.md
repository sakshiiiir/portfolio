### Data Analytics Projects

**[Exploratory Data Analysis Mental Health](https://github.com/sakshiiiir/EDA-Mental-Health)** | R Studio, Statistical Modeling
- Applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R Studio to predict anxiety disorder rates from 1990 to 2019 across 157 countries. Analyzed correlations between GDP, population age structure, gender, and anxiety prevalence. Developed a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to estimate and predict anxiety levels over time, providing insights into global trends and key influencing factors.

**[Time Series Analysis: Energy Analytics and Prediction](https://github.com/sakshiiiir/Time-Series-Analysis-Energy-Analytics)** | Python, Flask
- Applied time series analysis and ARIMA forecasting in Python for energy analytics, optimizing natural gas production, consumption, and management. Extended the project by developing a Flask-based app for user-friendly analysis and future predictions, enabling more accessible and accurate energy forecasting.
