Projects: 
1. Smart Glasses for Indoor Object Detection to Assist Visually Impaired using RaspberryPi:
   - This Project talks about object detection using a set up a real time object detection by connecting a camera to RaspberryPi and providing an audio output to the end user, which can be be usued by visually impaired. It is a prototype which requires further fine tuning of setup and latency. For the object detection we used the TensorFlow API and COCO SSD Mobile Net v1, with less than 1% training loss. 

2. Classroom Scene Recognition for monitoring using MobileNet:
   - This project revolves around indoor scene detection It mainly talks about identifying the indoor scene from broadly 4 categories concert hall, meeting hall, auditorium. The model is trained on the MIT67 data, which is a pre defined dataset. We first applied the machine learning approaches of feture extraction using GIST, DAISY, and HOG for features and used SVM as a classifier. In order to improve the model, we later trained a model by applying transfer learning with MobileNet and Keras. Once the scene identification is done, we focus on detecting and identifying the number of students using haar classifier, followed by binary classfication of gender using CNN.

3. ASL Classification for 3D point cloud using PointNet:
  - Focused identifying american sign language and comprehending it so that it can create co-existing environment. The data points consist 24 static alphabets of 3-D point clouds instead of 2-D data. The data points were captured using a pointflex camera. For visualisation and analysis of the point cloud, we used meshlab. For pre-processing and classification, we used the pointnet architecture.
    
4. Data Mining Course Project :
  - PCOS prediction using ML. The project involves around applying concepts on data mining. To do so, we chose a PCOS dataset from kaggle. There are several women affected by this and though eda we found that features like Follicle number, weight gain, cycle (R/I), skin darkening
and hair growth contribute the most towards prediction of PCOS. Out of classfiiers bagging, random forest and adaboost, random forest gives a decent accuracy of 91%.

5. Time Series Analysis : Energy Analytics and Prediction
- Applying the concepts of time series analysis and forecasting in R. We attempt to work on energy analytics in order to optimize energy production, consumption, and management thatâ€™ll lead to a sustainable energy system with respect to the demand and supply of resources. We focus on natural gas. The data is taken from the eia.gov. This is extended to a app which can cater to a user to analys the future predictions, by deploying a app using render.
  
6. Social Media Mining :
- This project focuses on working with social media data. Reviews are a big part of online community. It involves several data preprocessing techniques like correcting spelling errors and processing emojis to extract valuable insights and tackling the class imbalance. By analyzing more than 82,816 Amazon mobile reviews across three categories: neutral, negative and positive, the study demonstrates the efficacy of the methodology, with the Bi-LSTM deep learning model achieving an 88% accuracy rate, followed by Bi-RNN with 82%. 

7. Exploratory Data Analysis Mental Health:
- EDA concepts in R are applied. This analysis is about predicting anxiety disorder rates spanning from 1990 to 2019 across 157 countries. Key questions explore how GDP, population age structure, and gender relate to the prevalence of anxiety disorders. Models estimate the relationships and predictive power between potential explanatory factors like GDP, male and female population percentage, and anxiety levels over time. 
    
8. Engineering Cloud Computing : Skin Cancer Using AWS
- This project aims to leverage AWS cloud services to develop a robust and scalable skin cancer detection system. Utilizing AWS technologies like 
Amazon Rekognition and Amazon SageMaker, the project proposes a solution to enhance diagnostic accuracy and addresses challenges related to scalability, cost, and global accessibility.

9. Deep Learning Systems : Super Resolution GAN
- This project addresses challenges in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs), by integrating transfer learning, depthwise convolution, and attention layers into the SRGAN framework.Evaluation metrics, including perceptual loss, adversarial 
loss, PSNR, and SSIM, demonstrate the efficacy of the model on celebHQ and div2K datasets.
